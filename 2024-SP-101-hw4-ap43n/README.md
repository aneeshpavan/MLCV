# Instructions for Cloning hw4 folder

Students will be given access to the Git repository as 'developers'. As a result, they can clone the master branch and submit their respective assignments by following the procedure given below:

## Execute once, to clone a repository:
```
$ git clone https://git-classes.mst.edu/2022-SP-CS6406/<repository_name>.git
```

## Execute as many times as you like from within the directory/repository you cloned to your hard drive (just an example):
```
# To check the status of your repository:
$ git status

# To stage/add a file:
$ git add *.py *.pdf *.md

# To add a folder:
$ git add SUBDIRECTORY/*

# To commit changes and document them:
$ git commit -m "Informative description of the commit"

# To submit your assignments:
$ git push
```


## Do not add:
Compiled or generated files like *.out, *.log, *.syntex.gz, *.bib, your executable files, etc. Put the name of these files in a text file named .gitignore
